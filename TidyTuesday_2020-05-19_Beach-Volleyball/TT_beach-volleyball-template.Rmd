# Mini-challenge

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to complete a mini-data visualisation challenge by the end of the day. You can use and edit this template RMD. My code is here: 

## 1. Set up GitHub

You can definitely do this challenge even if you haven't sorted out your GitHub yet, but I'd strongly recommend making this one of your ISSC goals. More information in [the first 6 Sigma Sunday newsletter](https://utoronto.sharepoint.com/sites/ArtSci-STA/ISSC/SitePages/6.aspx). You may wish to create a repository to store this mini-project in called 'ISSC' or 'TidyTuesday' folder. I have one called ['ISSC'](https://github.com/elb0/ISSC) with the files from the this AND the two previous TidyTuesday & Talks.

## 2. Create an R Markdown document 
Or it could be an R Script, but I prefer RMDs, like what this is written in. It is perfect for when you want your code, outputs and commentary to all be together.

```{r, out.width = "50%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rmarkdown_wizards.png")

# Notice how I am using a code chunk to load an image and hiding this code with echo=FALSE
```

## 3. Install/load packages

If you haven't installed `tidyverse` yet, you will need that package for today. It has `dplyr` and `ggplot` in it.
```{r, out.width = "20%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tidyverse_celestial.png")
```

```{r, message=FALSE}
#install.packages("tidyverse")
library("tidyverse")

# Notice how I am using message=FALSE in this chunk to suppress the information about loading tidyverse. I don't what this as part of my final document because it isn't very pretty. Always suppress with care though, and if you're running in to issues, make sure to check this.
```


## 4. Load the data for this week.

There is more than one way to get this data. I'm going to use the `tidytuesdayR` package becasue I installed it last week. Choose the way that is right for you from [these options.](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-05-19/readme.md#get-the-data-here)

```{r}

```

## 5. Take a look at the data

The `glimpse()` function is very useful here. So is `head()` and `str()`.

```{r}

```

## 6. Wrangle the data
This data is pretty clean and tidy but we might want to play with a few things.

```{r}

```


## 7. Create at least 3 exploratory plots/summary statistics.

You might find the [Cookbook for R graphics from the BBC](https://bbc.github.io/rcookbook/) helpful, as well as the resources in [6 Sigma Sunday #2](https://utoronto.sharepoint.com/sites/ArtSci-STA/ISSC/SitePages/6%CF%83-Sunday--2.aspx) on using dplyr and ggplot.

### Explore!

```{r}

```

### Explore!

```{r}

```

### Explore!

```{r}

```


## 8. Choose one plot to improve and use/include the following:

### A title and subtitle
```{r}

```

### Labelled axes
```{r}

```

### A caption acknowledging the data source + your name
```{r}

```

### An appropriate colour palette
```{r}

```

### Explicitly use a theme (check out this list of defaults included with ggplot or get the ggtheme package)
```{r}

```

### BONUS: Add an annotation
```{r}

```


## 9. Save the plot using ggsave().

If you run `?ggsave`, it will tell you that "`ggsave()` is a convenient function for saving a plot. It defaults to saving the last plot that you displayed, using the size of the current graphics device. It also guesses the type of graphics device from the extension."

```{r}

```


## 10. Share the plot and link to your commented code with all your working in #portfolio-building with a 1â€“2 sentence explanation by the end of Tuesday May 19 (bonus if you share it on Twitter with #TidyTuesday). Our ISSC Tweeps are on [this list](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1258455620111515648/members). Message me if you want to be added!
