# ISSC

This repo is for sharing work created for the [Independent Summer Statistics Community](https://utoronto.sharepoint.com/sites/ArtSci-STA/ISSC/SitePages/ISSC-Home.aspx) in the Department of Statistical Sciences at the Univeristy of Toronto. 

Recordings and other resources can be found at on the ISSC [Past events](https://utoronto.sharepoint.com/sites/ArtSci-STA/ISSC/SitePages/Past-events.aspx) page. 

Note: If you're not one of our students and so do not have access to the SharePoint, feel free to get in touch on Twitter and I'll let you know what I can share. [@Liza_Bolton](https://twitter.com/Liza_Bolton)
